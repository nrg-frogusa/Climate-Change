# Climate-Change

This repository will contain all necessary data, data analysis, and conclusions to determine relationships of variables, such as sea surface temperature, regarding climate change.


# Data Analysis

First, I plotted the moving 20-year average of the data set using spectral analysis. This was to determine direction and magnitude of change in sea surface temperature. Through this step, I determined that sea surface temperatures were rising at a commensurate rate over the past few decades and decided this variable was suitable for examining further. 


Next, I used time series forecasting to forecast the next 20 years. These results were compelling in that it indicated a deceleration of sea surface temperatures.
